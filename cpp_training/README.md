# Intro
These code is a part of bachelor thesis. It's divided into two sections:
1. The first one serves as base-line solution of the problem. It is not primariy meant to be final solution, but there is some probability at it could end like that, because of the problem's nature.
2. The second one should be the final solution, which could be used in production or to solve real problems like that. As mentioned above, there could be small difference between the base-line and final solution, even no difference is possible.

# Base-line part
- This code implements algorithm as written below:
